        <div class="font-bold">BANSOS App with Biometric (Government Pilot Project)</div>
        <p>This project served as my introduction to LinkAja, where I had to quickly adapt to the company's culture and technology stack.</p>

        <div class="font-bold">Pesantren App with Biometric (Government Pilot Project)</div>
        <p>
          Upon my promotion to Squad Leader, I assumed a first leadership role in the "Biometric Phoneless Cash Transfer in Pesantren Environment."
          Facing tight deadlines and resource constraints, I decided to streamline the project's architecture and workflow, significantly reducing the
          number of microservices. I actively shaped the development process, introducing efficiency and improving the project's delivery time.
          Additionally, I also involved the creation of an experimental biometric recognition engine and also involved in conducted thorough talks and
          evaluations for externel AI vendors for potential integration.
        </p>

        <div class="font-bold">BANSOS App with QRIS (Government Pilot Project)</div>
        <p>
          In the "BANSOS government pilot app with QRIS," I encountered the complex task of integrating with five government banks within a tight
          two-month deadline, despite the banks being unprepared. We deliberately decided to took the lead and created a standardized specification
          for the banks, allowing us to build our application in parallel with their progress. This proactive decision resulted in an on-time delivery
          with minimal issues.
        </p>

        <div class="font-bold">Prakerja Bulk Disburse System</div>
        <p>
          I was responsible for development of a substantial daily disbursements, very often reaching billions of rupiah a day. Pretty high-stake. The
          focus of this project was on asynchronous bulk execution integrations with bank and government entity, with a strong emphasis on the
          accuracy of financial transactions. We successfully resolved challenges, ensuring no financial losses occurred ever.
        </p>

        <div class="font-bold">Supermarket QR Payment System</div>
        <p>
          To take active part on ongoing core migration process, we decided to take the "Supermarket QR Payment System" project. This project involved
          the complex task of rewriting a legacy system from Node.js to Golang, in spite of very limited documentation. To complete this project, we
          decided adopted a creative approach, including reverse engineering, code comprehension, and reestablishing communication with long-lost
          integration partners. Directing and problem-solving skills was tested. But in the end, we ensured the timely delivery of the project with
          minimal bugs. This feature personally very fulfilling as it is our first user facing feature that we can use ourselves. Remains a part of my
          daily routine.

        <div class="font-bold">Many Common App Mini Binding & Integrations with Third Parties through Webview</div>
        <p>
          While this project may not have been exceptionally challenging from a technical standpoint, the amount of integrations to do are numerous.
          My team and I effectively managed the integration of numerous third-party services carefully, ensuring maintainability and stability to
          ensure no failings can be snowballing bottlenecks on our other priority projects.

        <div class="font-bold">Dormant Account Deduction System</div>
        <p>
          We developed "Dormant Account Deduction System". It was a project of significant importance, as it played a vital role in recovering dormant
          funds that sustained the company during challenging fiscal years.

          This diverse range of experiences at LinkAja has equipped me with valuable technical and leadership skills, showcasing my ability to take

      <div class="bg-gray-50 px-6 py-6 text-gray-700 leading-loose mt-3 accordion-content text-sm" id="content-2">
        <p>
          At Bukalapak.com, I served as a Software Engineer (Backend) in the RETRO/APOLLO Promo and Retention Squad within the Mitra O2O Division. In
          this role, I worked on three significant projects:
        </p>

        <div class="font-bold">Transaction Loyalty Points System</div>

        <p>
          As a junior backend engineer, I was part of the team responsible for designing and developing this system from scratch. The key challenge
          was adapting to a new technology stack, primarily Ruby on Rails (RoR). The impact of this project was the introduction of a loyalty system
          aimed at increasing transactions and introducing a new line of business known as "Agen Bukalapak," disrupting the traditional distribution
          of fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG).
        </p>

        <div class="font-bold">Loyalty Point Rewards Redemption System</div>

        <p>
          Again in a junior backend role, I contributed to the development of this system, focusing on enhancing the user experience. The primary
          impact was on user engagement and increased transactions. Although the impact wasn't significantly pronounced, it was a valuable learning
          experience.
        </p>

        <div class="font-bold">Mitra Mission (Gamification)</div>

        <p>
          In this project, my team delved into the world of gamification. We designed a complex user journey system with gamification elements,
          emphasizing the prevention of potential fraudulent activities. Unfortunately, the project was discontinued due to reorganization, but it
          served as a valuable lesson in the challenges of project management and complex system design.
        </p>

        <div class="font-bold">Summary</div>

        <p>
          Throughout my work at Bukalapak.com, I utilized a technology stack that included Ruby on Rails (RoR), MySQL, MongoDB, and RabbitMQ with a
          Dead Letter Queue (DLQ) for task queueing. I encountered various challenges, including adapting to new technology stacks, exposure to
          concepts like CI/CD, safe database migrations, RFCs, and building my first asynchronous message-based system. Additionally, I had the
          opportunity to take on the role of a Scrum Master for a period, expanding my skill set in project management.
        </p>

        <p>
          This work experience at Bukalapak.com allowed me to gain valuable insights into e-commerce, product-based engineering, and the challenges
          and opportunities presented by a fast-paced, dynamic, unicorn company environment.

      <div class="font-bold text-lg">Squad Lead & Senior Specialist Engineer</div>
      <div class="text-gray-600 mb-1">LinkAja! (PT. Fintek Karya Nusantara/Finarya)</div>

        <div class="font-bold">BANSOS App with Biometric (Government Pilot Project)</div>
        <p>This project served as my introduction to LinkAja, where I had to quickly adapt to the company's culture and technology stack.</p>

        <div class="font-bold">Pesantren App with Biometric (Government Pilot Project)</div>
        <p>
          Upon my promotion to Squad Leader, I assumed a first leadership role in the "Biometric Phoneless Cash Transfer in Pesantren Environment."
          Facing tight deadlines and resource constraints, I decided to streamline the project's architecture and workflow, significantly reducing the
          number of microservices. I actively shaped the development process, introducing efficiency and improving the project's delivery time.
          Additionally, I also involved the creation of an experimental biometric recognition engine and also involved in conducted thorough talks and
          evaluations for externel AI vendors for potential integration.
        </p>

        <div class="font-bold">BANSOS App with QRIS (Government Pilot Project)</div>
        <p>
          In the "BANSOS government pilot app with QRIS," I encountered the complex task of integrating with five government banks within a tight
          two-month deadline, despite the banks being unprepared. We deliberately decided to took the lead and created a standardized specification
          for the banks, allowing us to build our application in parallel with their progress. This proactive decision resulted in an on-time delivery
          with minimal issues.
        </p>

        <div class="font-bold">Prakerja Bulk Disburse System</div>
        <p>
          I was responsible for development of a substantial daily disbursements, very often reaching billions of rupiah a day. Pretty high-stake. The
          focus of this project was on asynchronous bulk execution integrations with bank and government entity, with a strong emphasis on the
          accuracy of financial transactions. We successfully resolved challenges, ensuring no financial losses occurred ever.
        </p>

        <div class="font-bold">Supermarket QR Payment System</div>
        <p>
          To take active part on ongoing core migration process, we decided to take the "Supermarket QR Payment System" project. This project involved
          the complex task of rewriting a legacy system from Node.js to Golang, in spite of very limited documentation. To complete this project, we
          decided adopted a creative approach, including reverse engineering, code comprehension, and reestablishing communication with long-lost
          integration partners. Directing and problem-solving skills was tested. But in the end, we ensured the timely delivery of the project with
          minimal bugs. This feature personally very fulfilling as it is our first user facing feature that we can use ourselves. Remains a part of my
          daily routine.
        </p>

        <div class="font-bold">Many Common App Mini Binding & Integrations with Third Parties through Webview</div>
        <p>
          While this project may not have been exceptionally challenging from a technical standpoint, the amount of integrations to do are numerous.
          My team and I effectively managed the integration of numerous third-party services carefully, ensuring maintainability and stability to
          ensure no failings can be snowballing bottlenecks on our other priority projects.
        </p>

        <div class="font-bold">Dormant Account Deduction System</div>
        <p>
          We developed "Dormant Account Deduction System". It was a project of significant importance, as it played a vital role in recovering dormant
          funds that sustained the company during challenging fiscal years.
        </p>

        <div class="font-bold">Summary</div>
        <p>
          This diverse range of experiences at LinkAja has equipped me with valuable technical and leadership skills, showcasing my ability to take
          the lead, solve complex problems, and effectively contribute to the financial stability of the company.

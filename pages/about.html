      <div class="font-semibold text-xs text-gray-400 leading-none">2019-NOW</div>
      <div class="font-bold text-lg">Squad Lead & Senior Specialist Engineer</div>
      <div class="text-gray-600 mb-1">LinkAja! (PT. Fintek Karya Nusantara/Finarya)</div>

        <div class="font-bold">BANSOS App with Biometric (Government Pilot Project)</div>
        <p>This project served as my introduction to LinkAja, where I had to quickly adapt to the company's culture and technology stack.</p>

        <div class="font-bold">Pesantren App with Biometric (Government Pilot Project)</div>
        <p>
          Upon my promotion to Squad Leader, I assumed a leadership role in the "Pesantren government pilot app with biometric." Facing tight
          deadlines and resource constraints, I streamlined the project's architecture and workflow, significantly reducing the number of
          microservices. I actively shaped the development process, introducing efficiency and improving the project's delivery time. Additionally, I
          spearheaded the creation of a biometric recognition engine and conducted thorough evaluations of AI vendors for potential integration.
        </p>

        <div class="font-bold">BANSOS App with QRIS (Government Pilot Project)</div>
        <p>
          In the "BANSOS government pilot app with QRIS," my leadership and proactive approach were instrumental. My team encountered the complex task
          of integrating with five government banks within a tight two-month deadline, despite the banks being unprepared. I personally took the lead
          and created a standardized specification for the banks, allowing us to build our application in parallel with their progress. This proactive
          decision resulted in an on-time delivery with minimal issues.
        </p>

        <div class="font-bold">Prakerja Bulk Disburse System</div>
        <p>
          As a manager overseeing the "Prakerja bulk fund distribution system," I was responsible for the substantial daily disbursements, often
          reaching billions of rupiah. The focus of this project was on asynchronous integrations with various banks and government entities, with a
          strong emphasis on the accuracy of financial transactions. I played a crucial role in successfully resolving challenges, ensuring no
          financial losses occurred.
        </p>

        <div class="font-bold">Supermarket QR Payment System</div>
        <p>
          The "User Shopping Payment in the supermarket" project involved the complex task of rewriting a legacy system from Node.js to Golang,
          despite the limited documentation. To complete this project, I adopted a creative approach, including reverse engineering, code
          comprehension, and communication with integration partners. My leadership and problem-solving skills ensured the timely delivery of the
          project with minimal bugs. This feature remains a part of my daily routine, accessible from the comfort of my home.
        </p>

        <div class="font-bold">Many Common App Mini Binding & Integrations with Third Parties through Webview</div>
        <p>
          While the "Many common app mini binding & integrations with third parties through webview" project may not have been exceptionally
          challenging from a technical standpoint, my team and I effectively managed the integration of numerous third-party services, ensuring smooth
          operations without becoming bottlenecks in other projects.
        </p>

        <div class="font-bold">Dormant Account Deduction System</div>
        <p>
          The "Dormant Account Deduction System" was a project of significant importance, as it played a vital role in recovering dormant funds that
          sustained the company during challenging fiscal years.
        </p>

        <div class="font-bold">Summary</div>
        <p>
          This diverse range of experiences at LinkAja has equipped me with valuable technical and leadership skills, showcasing my ability to take
          the lead, solve complex problems, and effectively contribute to the financial stability of the company.

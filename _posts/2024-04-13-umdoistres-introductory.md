Morning, I just turned 28 few days ago. Congratulations me! ðŸª‡

It's been a while since I wrote posts. I've been having some difficulty in coming up with topics to write lately. I actually want to write more techs but I just feel like I still don't have many good stuff to write about that can add to everyone's already brilliant articles in the wild. Yeah, I do know that is a limiting belief but yeah really I just can't come up with things.

Hence why, to keep the writing streak going and to build some ideas banks, I decided to make some fallback writing format that I'll be writing on when I cannot come up with things.

This will be called **Um-Dois-TrÃªs**. Figure, it's a Portuguese of 1-2-3. So the idea is, in this format I'll be sharing about:
- **1** Absurd/abstract open questions. *These things pops up daily so I hope have many in stock haha.*
- **2** Newly learnt topics/things.
- **3** Interesting online stuffs I encountered. *It can be a post, videos, or even a marketplace product maybe? We'll see.*

This is not an original idea though, because actually this is a format that inspired by many email newsletters. One that I recently read that made me decide this was [botakasu's newsletter](https://newsletter.botakasu.com/) (written in Indonesian). Quite simple but can show the uniqueness of the author.

Let's hope this fallback format can help me write regularly and builds up the bank ideas so I can write more in-depth articles in the future. Ciao~

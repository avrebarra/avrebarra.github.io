DDD means Domain Driven Design, we all knew this.

DDD could also means Damn Disis Deeply-nested

DDD could also means Douchebag-coder Did Dat

DDD could also means Doh, Damn, Doh

DDD could also means Despicable Damned Design

It might seems like I despise it, but really I don't hate DDD. In fact I always try to ensure my code follows that.

Then? I just think that some people took it wrongly (or maybe I understood it wrong?). Makes me hate it when people start debating about structuring this like this to follow DDD, Hexagonal, Clean Code, MVC only leaving a jumbled deeply nested codebase after that.

From my honest perspective, DDD is an abstraction. That's that. Not a filename, not a folder names, not a project structure. I mean if we structured our codes flat, doesn't always mean we're not DDD-ing. We can do DDD principles with three files, even one file.

All abstraction are meant to help us explain and understand our code better. No you cannot say, "This project structured around DDD, just learn DDD concept here's the link." No jackshits, that's irresponsibility (especially knowing how deep DDD topics are). Honestly, if we devised a project with DDD and it made us took longer time for us to explain to any decent newcomer until they can visualize and continue it, then I believe something is missing.

I love DDD, and also MVC, three-tiers, two-tiers, OOP, Functional, Hexagonal, etc. Those are names of perspectives/telescopes/eyeglasses/loupes. They are tools to see our code from proven sides. Just how wasteful is it to limit a project to only one of them when you actually benefit from many on the same time?

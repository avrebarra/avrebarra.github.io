## Frontend Hosts
- **render.com**: it handles static sites with custom domains, yay!
- **surge.sh**: can do static site. Looks light and flexible.

## Backend & Cron Hosts
- **render.com**: it can do Go, Elixir, Express. Ah, also cron. Has free tier.
- **val.town**: do cron specifically.

## Databases
- **xata.io**: managed postgre with hella lotta steroids.
- **firebase.io**: yeah, that one.
- **sqlime.org**: online sqlite editor.
- **turso.tech**: managed globally-spread SQLite at large. Not so good UX-wise.

## Observability

Just uh references (mostly on simplistic designs)..
